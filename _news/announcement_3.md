[Atomic Imaging of 2D Transition Metal Diiodides](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c19196). We used DFT to calculate stacking energies to characterize stacking polytypes and their evolution with layer number. We also computed point and line defect formation energies, fitting a thermodynamic model to DFT to understand the conformation of edges in exfoliated samples.
