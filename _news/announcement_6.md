**New preprint on arXiv!**

[Charge distribution across dislocation networks induced by a strained top layer in hexagonal boron nitride substrates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21866). Strain acquired during assembly of van der Waals heterostructures can drive plastic deformations in hBN, creating dislocation networks. We show that the piezoelectric nature of hBN turns these dislocations into electrostatic charge hotspots, effectively acting as charged defects in the encapsulated 2D material.
