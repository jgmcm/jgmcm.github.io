**New arXiv preprint**

[Sub-nm Curvature Unlocks Quantum Flexoelectricity in Graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21996). First direct experimental and theoretical evidence for intrinsic quantum flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles, with measured polarization densities 5-7 orders of magnitude above mesoscale systems.
