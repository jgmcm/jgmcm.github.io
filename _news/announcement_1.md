[Sub-nm Curvature Unlocks Quantum Flexoelectricity in Graphene](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21996)

Recent preprint where we find the first direct experimental and theoretical evidence for intrinsic quantum flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles, with measured polarization densities which are 5-7 orders of magnitude above mesoscale systems.
