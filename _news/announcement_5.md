New preprint on arXiv! 🎉 [Refined DFT recipe and renormalisation of band-edge parameters for electrons in monolayer MoS2 informed by the measured spin-orbit splitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09858). Using diagrammatic methods, we demonstrate that conventional DFT severely underestimates spin-orbit splitting in the MoS2 conduction band. DFT+U+V, by correcting for inter-site interactions, resolves this discrepancy and offers an inexpensive route to quantitative accuracy for spintronic applications of transition metal dichalcogenides.
