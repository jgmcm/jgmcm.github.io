Using diagrammatic methods, we demonstrate that conventional DFT severely underestimates spin-orbit splitting in the MoS2 conduction band. DFT+U+V, by correcting for inter-site interactions, resolves this discrepancy and offers an inexpensive route to quantitative accuracy for spintronic applications of transition metal dichalcogenides.</p> </body></html>
