Strain acquired during assembly of van der Waals heterostructures can drive plastic deformations in hBN, creating dislocation networks. We show that the piezoelectric nature of hBN turns these dislocations into electrostatic charge hotspots, effectively acting as charged defects in the encapsulated 2D material.</p> </body></html>
