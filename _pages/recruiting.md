Since January 2025, I am a Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Research Fellow at the University of Manchester. My lab is centered on theoretical and computational, ab-initio and machine learning, modelling of complex electron density effects in two-dimensional materials.

### PhD

[Multi-modal AI models for designer ferroelectric devices](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/multi-modal-ai-models-for-designer-ferroelectric-devices/?p191593) (EPSRC CDT in Materials 4.0, Henry Royce Institute). This fully-funded project investigates multilayer functional devices built from stacked 2D semiconductors and magnetic materials. Using high-throughput DFT, machine-learning interatomic potentials (ACE/MACE), and multi-modal charge-aware models, we will explore how chemistry, stacking sequence, and interfacial twist control ferroelectric responses in sliding ferroelectric tunnel junctions, field-tuneable optoelectronics, and multiferroic memories.

### Post-doctoral fellows

We're always keen to hear from strong applicants — please email a CV and a short statement.

If you're interested in working with me, drop an email to james [dot] mchugh [at] manchester [dot] ac [dot] uk sharing more about your interests and background.
