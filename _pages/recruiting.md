Since January 2025, I am a Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Research Fellow at the University of Manchester. My lab is centered on theoretical and computational, ab-initio and machine learning, modelling of complex electron density effects in two-dimensional materials.

## PhD Studentships
I’m looking for motivated PhD candidates in any of the areas below. If your interests overlap, please get in touch.

- **Two-dimensional materials**
  - Fundamental DFT modelling of 2D magnets, metals and semiconductors  
  - High-throughput DFT screening of emerging 2D compounds
  
- **Twistronics**
  - Twistronic effects in incommensurate heterostructures
  - Wigner crystallisation, QAHE & other correlated phenomena in twisted TMDs and mirror-twin boundaries
  
- **Stacking ferromagnetism / ferroelectricity / multiferroics**
  - Engineering stacked multiferroic interfaces  
  - Altermagnetism & linear multiferroic effects via stacked monolayer anti/ferromagnets
  
- **Machine-learning potentials**
  - Graph-neural-network interatomic potentials  
  - Charge-density prediction  
  - Bayesian optimisation for MLIP and CD-ML models

If you’re interested in working with me on these topics, drop an email to james [dot] mchugh [at] manchester [dot] ac [dot] uk sharing more about your interests and background!
