I am a theoretical physicist studying two-dimensional materials at the National Graphene Institute, University of Manchester. I am currently looking for talented PhD students, please see my "Recruiting" page for details of my general research interests and possible projects. If interested, don't hesitate to get in touch!

**Research interests**
- 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures
- Nanoconfined liquids (water/ions) in atomically thin membranes
- E(3)-equivariant GNN interatomic potentials and data-efficient ML for atomistic simulation
- First-principles and atomistic modelling (DFT, MD), statistical mechanics, transport and separations
